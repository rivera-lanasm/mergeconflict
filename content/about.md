I’m working currently as data engineer and research software developer with the Computational Social Science [Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) at UPenn. Here, I work on open-source tools, data pipelines for large, real time data sets, and cloud infrastructure on AWS.

I’ll be attending Heinz MSPPM (data analytics track) master's [program](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/public-policy-management-master/data-analytics) at CMU in Fall 2023.

Previously, I worked as a data scientist at a long/short equity hedge fund in NYC, and before that as a research analyst for investment manage, focusing on fixed income asset classes. As an undergraduate at UPenn, I majored in Economics, with minors in Statistics and International Relations.

I’m based in NYC, where I like to eat ramen
