I am a data engineer with the Computational Social Science [Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) at UPenn working on open-source tools, data pipelines for large data sets, and cloud infrastructure. The research I'm involved in here has primarily focused on analyzing trends in television and online news publication and consumption, and on developing large scale web crawling frameworks for running experiments simulating human behavior in order to analyze output of recommendation algorithms from sites such as Youtube.   

I’ll be attending Heinz MSPPM (data analytics track) master's [program](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/public-policy-management-master/data-analytics) at Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2023.

Previously, I worked as a data scientist and research analyst for a long/short equity hedge fund in NYC.

I’m based in NYC, where I like to eat ramen. Other hobbies include running, bouldering, Raspberry Pi projects, and making banana bread.
