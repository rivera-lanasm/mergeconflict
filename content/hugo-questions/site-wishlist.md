**Reference:**
- This site uses the [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme, so some of these answers might be specific to that. I'll try to generalize when appropriate

1. Understand how formatting from theme is imported into main application. For example, where to configure font size/style of navigation bar elements on title page
2. How to know what image specifications the image element, avatar.jpg, expects on title page
3. Hugo Pipes for Assets


**Site Quick References**
- [Hugo Directory Structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/)
- [Configuration File Settings](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/#all-configuration-settings)


**Styling**
- styling for hugo layout is defined under assets/scss. To overwrite a styling element, you can simply add an equivalent style file in the top level project directory. Avoid making changes to the theme source code.
