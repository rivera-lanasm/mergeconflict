### The server is friend, not food (sometimes)

I spent about two years between 2019 and 2022 working at an equity long/short hedge fund, where, ostensibly as a "data scientist", I developed most steps in our team's data engineering and analysis life cycle involving "alternative data". Since about the mid 2010's, the asset management industry has invested heavily in incorporating non-financial data sets into the investment evaluation process. Casting the net, [here](https://citywire.com/selector/news/the-top-three-alternative-data-sets-used-by-hedge-funds/a1353855). 

In any case, I was developing the infrastructure for this on AWS. 

This included discussing anomalies with data vendors, setting up web scraping jobs, testing frameworks orchestrated with [Airflow](...) to ensure last night's jobs succeeded, and finally designing (simple) models and web dashboards for my team's analysts hiring data scientists, hoping to reign in a new culture and investment culture joining traditional 

Among the more senior data engineers I interacted with, the most common suggestion was to continuously make my infrastrcture more "serverless" (less server-ful). The basic principle here is... 

The [Cattle vs. Pets](https://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/) analogy illustrates the principle. 

However, I'm developing personal projects here and, frankly, I felt like I was missing an opportunity to learn more about the servers I was so eager to condemn as commodified, basically abstract, entities. From this sentiment, I ordered as Raspberry Pi, a single-board computer, which could serve as both my own private ["cloud"](...), as well as an entry point to some ...
